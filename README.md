`flint`: Facebook's C++ Linter
-----------------------------

`flint` is an open-source lint program for C++ developed and used at Facebook.

`flint` is published on Github at https://github.com/facebook/flint; for
discussions, there is a Google group at https://groups.google.com/d/forum/facebook-flint.

There are two versions of `flint`. The main one (`flint/*.d`) is written in the D programming language and is supported going forward. We also provide our older implementation in C++ (`flint/cxx/*.cpp`) for historical perspective and comparison purposes.

Currently `flint`'s build has only been tested on Ubuntu. The motivated user should have no problem adapting it to other systems. More officially supported OSs to follow.
